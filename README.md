# Blockchain Brawlers Bot for Wax 
This is a quick bot to automate "brawls" on blockchain brawlers.
I'm quite a beginner, so i apologize if i haven't followed best practices or the code is ugly; I'm trying my best to learn and suggestions are appreciated.

# How to setup
In order to use the code you just have to go to the "config.js" file and add your wallet data.
You have to provide: 
- wallet address (multiple addresses are accepted)
- private key associated to wallet (mulitple keys are accepted)
- server endpoint (list of open [endpoints](https://wax.bloks.io/))
- waiting time until next brawl (in milliseconds)

Once you have set everything up you just need to run the index.js and you will be running automatic brawls. 

You must have an Anchor wallet in order to use this script

# Good to go !
I will appreciate any comments and critiques.

Thanks !
